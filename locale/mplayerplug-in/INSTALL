Source Code Releases:

The Mozilla developement files are needed to compile this code

To get the Mozilla development files there are two options
1. mozilla-devel package (includes pkg-config files)
2. gecko-sdk

1. The mozilla-devel package may come with your distribution and it is an optional install try using apt-get or yum or your package installer
2. The gecko-sdk can be obtained from mozilla.org (version 1.6 or higher of the SDK are the only ones that work)
http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mozilla/releases/mozilla1.6/
Extract the tar file in some directory

The GTK development files are needed to compile this code 
The X11 development files are needed to compile this code
Xpm development files are needed to compile this code
pkg-config is needed

To get the latest source from CVS do the following

cd to some directory

cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@mplayerplug-in.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/mplayerplug-in login
(just hit enter for password)

cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@mplayerplug-in.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/mplayerplug-in co mplayerplug-in

or, if you have already downloaded from CVS before.

cd [cvs root]/mplayerplug-in
cvs update -PAd


OR

download the source 

then

tar -xzvf mplayerplug-in-{version}.tar.gz
cd mplayerplug-in


BUILDING
In the mplayerplug-in directory type

Compilation options
--with-gecko-sdk=/path/to/gecko-sdk    (replace /path/to with the correct value)
--enable-gtk2				(default option, use if mozilla is linked to gtk2 libs)
--enable-gtk1				(use if mozilla is linked to gtk1 libs (usually if fonts in mozilla are not smooth))
--enable-x				(use if you don't know if your mozilla is linked to gtk1 or gtk2)


Examples:	
To configure with defaults:	
./configure

if you are using gecko-sdk do the following
./configure --with-gecko-sdk=/path/to/gecko-sdk    (replace /path/to with the correct value)

if you are using gecko-sdk and gtk1
./configure --with-gecko-sdk=/path/to/gecko-sdk --enable-gtk1

If you get this error during configure:  
checking for mozilla-plugin... Package mozilla-plugin was not found in the pkg-config search path.

You need to use the gecko-sdk option. Using gecko-sdk 1.6 with an earlier version of mozilla seems to be ok.

If you can't figure out what you need try running 

./whatoptions.sh 

in the mplayerplug-in directory.


After configure is done and successful:
make

If during the make process you get an error about missing "mozilla-config.h" and you are not using the gecko-sdk.
You need to use the gecko-sdk because your mozilla-devel package is incomplete.


The results of that command should produce files called mplayerplug-in.so and mplayerplug-in.xpt in the current directory.
