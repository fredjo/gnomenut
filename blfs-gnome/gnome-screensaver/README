README for gnome-screensaver

If you want to use xscreensaver hacks with gnome-screensaver, do the following:

1. Install xscreensaver and libxslt (if not already installed)
2. Migrate xscreensaver configs to gnome-screensaver format like so:

	# mkdir temp; cd temp
	# /usr/bin/migrate-xscreensaver-config /usr/share/xscreensaver/config/*.xml
	# mv *.desktop /usr/share/applications/screensavers/
	# cd ..; rmdir temp

3. Run gnome-screensaver-preferences and select a screensaver


** NOTE: If you have both xscreensaver and gnome-screensaver installed, there
will be two (2) entries in the GNOME preferences menu for "Screensaver". If you
want to get rid of the xscreensaver entry, move or delete the .desktop file,
/usr/share/applications/gnome-screensaver-properties.desktop.
