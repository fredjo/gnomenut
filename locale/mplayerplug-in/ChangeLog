	Removed mozilla requirement from spec file, for people that have firebird but not mozilla
	Merged in a patch from David Maybohm that should fix some possible buffer overruns
		1) Fix two memory leaks where return value of getURLFilename was not
		   freed.
		2) Use strlcat/strlcpy instead of strcpy/strcat. This are safer versions
		   of strcpy/strcat that include the destination buffer size.
		   Probably fixes a few holes, but is a good idea in general when
		   dealing with static buffers. In particular PluginInstance->url is
		   copied to Node->url, but PluginInstace->url looks like it's
		   dynamically allocated and Node->url is staticly 1024 chars). The most
		   serious bug was already fixed (only in CVS though) by using snprintf
		   in buildPlaylist to copy from a 4096-char buffer to a 1024-char
		   buffer.
		3) Use AC_REPLACE_FUNCS for memmem, strlcpy, strlcat. The object files
		   are added to the standard LIBOBJS variable that is substituted in
		   Makefile.in. The files are compiled only if the respective functions
		   are missing.
(omitted)	4) Simplify Makefile.in a little by using a pattern rule to build
		   objects. (This patch did not seem to work)
		5) Fix possible remote execution in playPlaylist() when the URL contains
		   double-quote or shell meta-characters, because the playlist URL could
		   be something like http://exploit.your.shell.com/";`touch
		   /tmp/0wn3d`;rm -rf $HOME;#, giving the command executed as

		   mplayer -playlist "http://exploit.your.shell.com";`touch /tmp/0wn3d`;rm -rf $HOME;#" <> /tmp/fifoXy9388

		   So, this patch single-quotes the URL, which will avoid interpolating
		   any shell metacharacters (like backquote, etc). But, there is still
		   the same problem if single-quote chars themselves are used in the
		   URL. So, this also truncates the URL at any quote characters. This is
		   obviously not good (but still better than exploitability): should
		   probably URL-encode any single-quotes, though i've never seen any URL
		   have a single-quote in it.
		6) Fix possibly non-terminated buffer in readMimeTypes()
		7) Fix miscalculated allocation length in mmsToHttp() [off by 1].

0.91
	No more forks, going to pthreads
	downloading flag is ignored for now, until we get some other things working.
	Usage of shared memory is gone for now.

0.90
	More work with the download option. Play video while still downloading, works with cache option
	Added another mimetype for realmedia
	Working on the DrawUI function when downloading, so we can have a counter so we can have a download counter.

		NOT USED: Added SendKey Function
	Changed to single SHM structure, vs multiple SHM ints
	Added fallback to smb:// when getting a file:// url that is not found
	Do not read codecs.conf file to determine mime types, but read config file for the following options
		enable-real=0|1		default to 0
		enable-qt=0|1		default to 1
		enable-wm=0|1		default to 1
		enable-mpeg=0|1		default to 1

		Mozilla only will evalate the mime types the plugin supports when the plugin is updated or when
		$HOME/.mozilla/pluginreg.dat is missing. So when you change the enable options you need to delete
		pluginreg.dat or touch mplayerplug-in.so
	Optionally you can use the option "use-mimetype=1" and this will get the list of mime types from the file mime.types
	Change the way playlists are downloaded from the sites. This will work much better for many sites especially when download=1
	Changed execlp to popen, this allows the loop to be done.
	Added in code to do a linked list, will be useful in post 0.90 version
	Added in buildPlaylist routine as a starting point. Several issues still
		1. Issues with async downloads
		2. The actual URL to download from, when mplayer reads a reference file the
			referenced files sometimes have relative urls which will cause
			some issues. Just will have to parse them out
		3. streaming internet radio could cause this process to lockup. Async will help in this area
		4. What are the implications of threads and the linked list pointers? Address space issues?
	If this new playlist code works, we should be able to download video from protected sites
	Discovered today why I keep crashing X, turns out you can't call Xlib functions from inside of a fork
		So I'll have to figure out ways around this...
	Got around the X crashing by using shared memory message passing.

		noembed		shows mplayer in separate window
		vo		overrides mplayer config
		ao		overrides mplayer config
