README for gnome


It's no longer necessary to set the XDG environment variables or
manually symlink /usr/etc/xdg to /etc/xdg, the gnome meta-port
Pkgfile creates the symlink for you.

*BUILD NOTE*
	GnuPG requires a /usr/sbin/sendmail. There are numerous ways
	to provide this, installing sendmail and postfix among them. The quickest
	method is probably to either touch a fake file there, or my preferred
	method, to install ssmtp from ports and symlink /usr/sbin/ssmtp to
	/usr/sbin/sendmail. GnuPG seems to be happy with that.

DBUS NOTE

	To use dbus correctly, it needs to run two different sessions. One of
	these is taken care of by the init script, /etc/rc.d/dbus. It's run
	as root and the user doesn't need to mess with it. The other session
	is started by the user and invoked like this:

		$ eval `dbus-launch --sh-syntax --exit-with-session`
		$ export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS
		$ export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_PID

	If you're using GDM, you don't need to do anything, gdm will launch
	dbus when you log in using /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/30dbus-launch.sh.
	If, on the other hand, you're running gnome-session from a .xinitrc
	file or the like, you'll need to put lines like the above into it.
